**Update 23/6/2022**
 
I'm choosing to revive this project, as there are still people who find this software useful in 2022.

My main focus areas will be:

- ðŸ”ƒ Converting codebase to Typescript, updating software versions
- âš™ Adding simple MIDI input management
- ðŸ“¦ Creating binary releases for Windows/ Linux/ Mac
- ðŸŽ¨ UI improvements
- ðŸ’¬ Anything else I missed? Create a feature request via a GitHub Issue!
